# Explanation of BigramLanguageModel

## Overview of Bigram Model
A bigram language model is a simple statistical model used for predicting the next word (or character) in a sequence based solely on the immediately preceding one. In this case, it's a character-level model trained on the Shakespeare corpus from `input.txt`.

Unlike neural language models (e.g., GPT), which use layers of neurons to learn complex patterns and representations through backpropagation and optimization, a bigram model doesn't require any neural architecture. It relies purely on counting frequencies of character pairs (bigrams) from the training data and using those counts to compute probabilities. This makes it a non-parametric, rule-based approach that's easy to implement and understand but limited to short-range dependencies.

## Breakdown of the Code Implementation
The code in `my_bigram.py` implements this as follows:

1. **Data Preparation and Tokenization**:
   - Load the text from `input.txt`.
   - Create a vocabulary of unique characters (about 65, including letters, punctuation, and newline).
   - Map characters to indices (e.g., `chars = sorted(list(set(text)))`; `stoi = {ch:i for i,ch in enumerate(chars)}`).
   - Convert the text to a tensor of indices: `data = torch.tensor(encode(text), dtype=torch.long)`.

2. **Counting Bigrams**:
   - Split data into input-target pairs: for each position `i`, input is `data[i]` (previous char), target is `data[i+1]` (next char).
   - Build a count matrix `N` (vocab_size x vocab_size) where `N[prev, next] += 1` for each pair.
   - This is done efficiently with a loop or vectorized operations.

3. **Computing Probabilities**:
   - Normalize counts to probabilities: `P = N.float() / N.sum(1, keepdim=True)`.
   - `P[i, j]` now represents the empirical probability that character `j` follows character `i`, based on the training data.

4. **Generation**:
   - Start with a seed index (e.g., 0 for newline '\n').
   - Iteratively sample the next index from a multinomial distribution over `P[current, :]`.
   - Decode the index back to character and append to the output string.
   - Repeat for a fixed number of steps (e.g., 200 characters) to generate text.

## Why It Works Without Neural Layers
The model doesn't need neural layers because it uses a direct statistical approximation: predictions are lookups from a precomputed probability table derived from raw counts. No parameters are learned via gradients; instead, it leverages the frequency hypothesis (common patterns in data reflect likely sequences). This is sufficient for basic next-character prediction but lacks the ability to capture long-range dependencies or generalize beyond seen bigrams (e.g., no smoothing in this basic version, so unseen bigrams have zero probability).

Neural models parameterize these probabilities implicitly through weights in layers, allowing for hierarchical feature learning and handling longer contexts via attention mechanisms.

## Simple Example of Prediction/Generation
Suppose the training data has frequent bigrams like '\n' followed by 'T' (start of sentences) or 'h' followed by 'i' (in "hi").

- To predict after '\n': Sample from `P[0, :]` – might pick 'T' with high prob, generating "\nThe".
- Full generation: Start with '\n', sample next (say 'h'), then after 'h' sample 'i', then after 'i' sample ' ', etc., yielding something like "\nhii there\nJuliet...\n" – repetitive due to corpus biases.

In code, generation looks like:
```python
for _ in range(200):
    ix = torch.multinomial(P[ctx], 1)
    ctx = ix
    out += decode(ix)
```

## Relation to the Broader GPT Tutorial
This bigram model is a foundational baseline in the "GPT from Scratch" tutorial (likely nanoGPT or similar). It demonstrates core concepts like tokenization, next-token prediction, and generation loss (cross-entropy on targets) without complexity. The tutorial builds up to a transformer-based GPT by adding embeddings, positional encodings, self-attention layers, and more, showing how neural architectures improve perplexity and coherence over simple stats.
